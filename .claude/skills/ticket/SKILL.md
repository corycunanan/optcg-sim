# Work a Linear Ticket

End-to-end workflow for taking a Linear ticket from "I'm starting this" to "PR is open and Linear is in review," with a cross-session handoff trail.

## Argument

`$ARGUMENTS` is expected to be a Linear issue ID like `OPT-123`.
- If missing or not matching `^OPT-\d+$`, stop and ask the user for a valid ID. Do not guess.

---

## Phase 1 — Pre-flight

Do not begin any work until all of these pass. Run them in parallel where possible.

1. **Working tree is clean.** `git status --porcelain` must return empty. If dirty, stop and surface the changes — do not stash or discard without confirmation.
2. **No open PRs by the user.** `gh pr list --author @me --state open` must be empty. If any are open, list them and confirm before continuing (they may be abandoned work or in-review work the user forgot about).
3. **`main` is current and reachable.**
   - `git fetch origin main`
   - `git rev-parse HEAD` on local `main` matches `origin/main`. If not, check out `main` and pull fast-forward. If local `main` has diverged, stop and surface.
4. **Last merged PR is actually on `main`.** `gh pr list --state merged --limit 1 --json mergeCommit,number` — the merge commit should be reachable from `origin/main`.
5. **Linear and GitHub CLI are reachable.** If `gh auth status` fails or the `mcp__linear-server__*` tools error, stop and surface; do not fall back to guessing.

---

## Phase 2 — Fetch ticket + load handoff context

Run in parallel:
- `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` with the ticket ID.
- `mcp__linear-server__list_issue_statuses` for the team (needed for status transitions — never hard-code status names).

From the issue, extract: `title`, `description`, `state`, `priority`, `estimate`, `labels`, `project`, `assignee`, `url`, and any linked/blocking issues.

**Load the project handoff doc if it exists:**
- If the issue has a Linear project, slugify the project name (`lowercase-kebab-case`) and read `docs/project/handoffs/<slug>.md`.
- If it exists, surface the Action Plan row for this ticket and any inbound handoff prompt targeting this ticket.
- If the most recent handoff entry is more than **7 days old**, note it as potentially stale — re-verify against `git log` before trusting specific file/function claims.
- If the ticket has unresolved blockers (still Todo/In Progress in Linear), list them and ask the user whether to proceed.

---

## Phase 3 — Branch

Branch name format (match existing repo convention from `git log`):

```
corymcunanan/opt-<num>-<slug>
```

- `<num>` is the issue number.
- `<slug>` is the issue title, lowercased, non-alphanumerics → `-`, collapsed, trimmed, max ~60 chars. Do **not** hand-edit — slug from the Linear title verbatim so it's recognizable.

Create and check out:

```
git checkout -b corymcunanan/opt-<num>-<slug>
```

If the branch already exists, stop and ask — may be recovery work from a prior session.

**Update Linear to "In Progress"** via `mcp__linear-server__save_issue` (resolve the exact status name from `list_issue_statuses`). Set assignee to the current user if unset.

---

## Phase 4 — Understand before touching

Before edits:

1. Re-read the issue description closely. Note acceptance criteria, linked docs/PRs, and specific file mentions.
2. Audit the codebase for entry points relevant to the issue — use Grep/Glob, not guesswork. If the surface is wide or cross-cutting, spawn an `Explore` agent with a specific question.
3. If the ticket is ambiguous (multiple reasonable interpretations, wrong one wastes hours), **ask** rather than pick. Auto mode is not a license to guess on scope.
4. If the work needs a plan (>~3 files, new abstractions, new deps), write a short plan in chat first and proceed.

---

## Phase 5 — Implement with atomic commits

- Commit at **meaningful checkpoints**, not arbitrary line counts. A single logical concern = a single commit is fine. Two separable concerns (e.g., "add schema" + "consume schema") = two commits.
- Commit message format matches repo convention: **imperative sentence, ending with `(OPT-XXX)`**, optional body.
  ```
  Rate-limit /api/game/result and document secret rotation (OPT-188)
  ```
- Do **not** batch unrelated refactors, formatting passes, or tangential fixes into the ticket commit. Raise them as follow-ups in the handoff doc.
- Never `--amend` a pushed commit. Never `--no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the root cause.
- Run project checks before the final commit: `npm run type-check`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`. If any fail, fix before PR.

**Always create a final commit before opening the PR** — do not let uncommitted work get stranded.

---

## Phase 6 — Open the PR

1. `git push -u origin <branch>`.
2. Title: same shape as the last commit — `<Imperative description> (OPT-XXX)`. Keep under 70 chars.
3. Body: use the repo's existing format (see recent merged PRs via `gh pr view <N> --json body`). Structure:

   ```
   ## Summary
   - <1-3 bullets — the "why," not a line-by-line diff recap>
   - Link to the Linear issue: https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-XXX

   ## Test plan
   - [x] npm run type-check
   - [x] npm run lint
   - [x] npm test
   - [ ] <manual verification steps if UI/UX changed>
   ```

4. Create via `gh pr create` with HEREDOC body.
5. **Update Linear to "In Review"** and attach the PR URL to the issue (via `save_issue` comment or attachment).

---

## Phase 7 — Write the handoff entry

For cross-session context transfer. See the `Handoff Docs` section below.

1. Ensure `docs/project/handoffs/<project-slug>.md` exists. If not, create from `docs/project/handoffs/_TEMPLATE.md` and fill the Action Plan from the Linear project's issues (ordered by dependencies → estimate → priority).
2. Update the Action Plan row for this ticket: status → **In Review**, PR link, date.
3. Append a new handoff section at the bottom keyed to the **next ticket** in the action plan (not the one just finished). Keep it tight — see the template.
4. Commit the handoff doc update **on the same branch** as the ticket work (single commit, message: `Add OPT-XXX → OPT-YYY handoff (OPT-XXX)`). This keeps the handoff bundled with the PR so reviewers see it.

---

## Phase 8 — After merge (post-PR, if the user asks you to close out)

If the user returns after the PR merges and asks you to close out:
1. Verify the PR is merged: `gh pr view <N> --json state,mergeCommit`.
2. Update Linear status → **Done**.
3. Update the Action Plan row in the handoff doc: status → Done, date.
4. Delete the local branch (`git branch -d`) and optionally the remote (`git push origin --delete`). Confirm before deleting remote.

---

## Handoff Docs

**Location:** `docs/project/handoffs/<linear-project-slug>.md` (one doc per Linear project).

**Purpose:** Carry context between agent sessions that work on different tickets in the same project. The goal is that a fresh session can read the doc + the ticket and be productive, without re-deriving the last session's findings from `git log`.

**What goes in a handoff entry (3–5 bullets, not an essay):**
- **Primer** — what changed at the system level (not file-by-file).
- **Files to read first** — paths the next agent should touch before editing.
- **Gotchas / do NOT touch** — areas the next agent should leave alone, and why.
- **Unresolved** — questions or deferred work, with tracking (another OPT-ID, a TODO, or "none").
- **Pointer** — commit SHA or PR number. The next agent runs `git show <sha>` for the diff; don't re-describe it.

**What does NOT go in a handoff:**
- A recap of the diff. That's what the commit/PR is for.
- Generic codebase knowledge — that belongs in `CLAUDE.md` or feature docs.
- Anything that would be obvious from reading the Linear ticket.

**Stale handoffs:** a handoff older than 7 days is a hint, not a source of truth. Re-verify claims against current code before acting on them.

---

## Failure modes — what to do

- **`gh` not authed** → stop, tell the user to run `gh auth login`. Do not proceed.
- **Linear MCP tool errors** → stop, surface the error. Do not silently skip status updates.
- **Branch already exists** → stop, ask whether this is recovery work or a naming collision.
- **Ticket has open blockers** → list them, confirm with user before branching.
- **Tests fail after implementation** → do not open the PR. Fix or escalate.
- **User interrupts mid-implementation** → commit WIP only if they ask; otherwise leave the tree as-is and surface state.

---

## Notes

- Status transitions use names **resolved at runtime** from `list_issue_statuses` (e.g., "In Progress," "In Review," "Done"). Team workflows vary; don't hard-code.
- Atomic commits are a guideline, not a quota. One cohesive change = one commit.
- This skill never force-pushes, never amends pushed commits, never uses `--no-verify`. Escalate instead.
