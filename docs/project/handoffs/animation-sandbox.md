# Animation Sandbox — Handoff Doc

A `/sandbox` surface for showcasing and validating atomic game-state animations in isolation. Each scenario is a declarative TS file that drives the real `BoardLayout` via a fake session provider, with per-scenario input gating (spectator vs interactive). Full scope: [`docs/project/ANIMATION-SANDBOX-SCOPE.md`](../ANIMATION-SANDBOX-SCOPE.md).

## Action Plan

Tickets in execution order. Ordering criteria: dependencies → estimate → priority → risk. The Linear project description is the source of truth if this table drifts.

| Order | Ticket | Title | Estimate | Depends on | Status | PR | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|------------|--------|----|-------|
| 1 | [OPT-285](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-285) | Sandbox foundation: scenario types + manifest + helpers | 1 | — | Done | [#129](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/129) | Gate ticket. Pure types + empty manifest + helper stubs. Unblocks OPT-286 and OPT-288. |
| 2 | [OPT-287](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-287) | Curated card-data bundle for sandbox | 1 | — | Backlog | — | Independent of everything else — can be done in parallel with the gate ticket if anyone wants to split. ~20 hand-picked `CardData` snapshots covering Blocker, Counter, Double Attack, Rush, On-Play, On-KO, Trigger event, Stage, plus per-color leaders. |
| 3 | [OPT-288](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-288) | Sandbox routes + navbar entry + scaffold migration | 2 | OPT-285 | In Review | [#135](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/135) | New top-level routes (`/sandbox`, `/sandbox/scaffold`, `/sandbox/[scenarioId]` placeholder), navbar entry, redirect from `/game/scaffold`. Hub UI reads the (initially empty) manifest. Independent of provider/runner work — can run in parallel with OPT-286/289. |
| 4 | [OPT-286](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-286) | Sandbox session provider + apply-event reducer | 3 | OPT-285 | Done | [#132](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/132) | The fake `useGameSession`. Critical path. Reducer is intentionally minimal — visible deltas only, no engine fork. Smoke test asserts `BoardLayoutProps` has no undefined fields (no JSDOM needed). |
| 5 | [OPT-289](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-289) | Scenario runner controller + playback model | 3 | OPT-285, OPT-286 | Done | [#133](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/133) | The brain. Folds `apply-event` over events 0..i. Exposes play/pause/reset/stepForward/resolvePrompt. Step-backward is a documented non-goal — noted in the file's top comment. |
| 6 | [OPT-290](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-290) | Input gate: spectator vs interactive | 2 | OPT-286, OPT-289 | Backlog | — | Wraps `sendAction`. Try the `interactionMode` prop on `BoardLayout` first; fall back to a pointer-events overlay only if prop addition touches >6 files. |
| 7 | [OPT-291](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-291) | Scenario player page: board + control bar + info panel | 3 | OPT-287, OPT-288, OPT-289, OPT-290 | Backlog | — | Assembly point. Wires provider + runner + gate + UI into the `[scenarioId]` route. After this lands, the architecture is fully observable. |
| 8 | [OPT-292](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-292) | Vertical slice: Draw 2 (spectator) + SELECT_TARGET (interactive) | 1 | OPT-291 | Backlog | — | The architecture's smoke test. Two scenarios that exercise the full pipeline. **If anything feels off here, patch the earlier ticket — don't paper over.** |
| 9 | [OPT-293](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-293) | Scenario batch: Draws & Movement (6 scenarios) | 2 | OPT-292 | Backlog | — | Parallelizable with OPT-294/295/296. Exercises `use-field-arrivals` and the multi-DON fan-out. |
| 10 | [OPT-294](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-294) | Scenario batch: Combat (5 scenarios) | 2 | OPT-292 | Backlog | — | Parallelizable. Counter-from-hand is the only interactive one in the batch; exercises `use-counter-pulse`. |
| 11 | [OPT-295](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-295) | Scenario batch: KO + Life (4 scenarios) | 2 | OPT-292 | Backlog | — | Parallelizable. All spectator. Exercises the `kind: "ko"` flight branch and `LIFE_TRASH_REASONS` routing. |
| 12 | [OPT-296](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-296) | Scenario batch: Prompts (4 interactive scenarios) | 2 | OPT-292 | Backlog | — | Parallelizable. Covers the four remaining prompt modals (`ARRANGE_TOP_CARDS`, `PLAYER_CHOICE`, `OPTIONAL_EFFECT`, `REVEAL_TRIGGER`). |
| 13 | [OPT-297](https://linear.app/optcg-sim/issue/OPT-297) | Polish: global mute default + clock determinism notes | 1 | OPT-291 | Backlog | — | Closeout. Mute toggle + persistence + the `docs/sandbox/clock-determinism.md` doc. Can be done any time after OPT-291; suggest doing it last so the determinism doc reflects what was actually built. |

**Status values:** use Linear status names verbatim (`Backlog`, `Todo`, `In Progress`, `In Review`, `Done`, `Canceled`).

**Next up:** OPT-290 (critical path) — ready now. OPT-287 still parallel and pickable now.

### OPT-285 → OPT-286
**From:** session on 2026-04-24 · **Commit:** `1ac7208` · **PR:** [#129](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/129)

- **Primer:** Scenario authoring contract is in place. `src/lib/sandbox/scenarios/{types,helpers,index}.ts` ship `Scenario`, `ScenarioStep`, `ExpectedResponse`, `PartialGameState`/`PartialPlayerState`, plus `makeCard` / `makeLifeStack` / `makeDonStack` / `playerSlot` helpers. The manifest exports `scenarios: Scenario[] = []`.
- **Read first:** `src/lib/sandbox/scenarios/types.ts` (the contract), `src/components/game/board-layout/board-layout.tsx` (props the provider must satisfy), `shared/game-types.ts` (full `GameState` shape — provider hydrates `PartialGameState` into this).
- **Gotchas / do NOT touch:** `ExpectedResponse.allowedActionTypes` is typed as `GameAction["type"][]`, not `string[]` — keep it that way; widening to `string[]` defeats the typo guard. `PartialGameState.players` is a tuple `[PartialPlayerState, PartialPlayerState]` — preserve the tuple-ness when hydrating so `players[0]` / `players[1]` stay non-null.
- **Unresolved:** None blocking. The reducer scope creep risk in `apply-event.ts` is real — the scope doc's "Risks" section calls it out; resist the urge to handle every event type up front.
- **Why this matters for OPT-286:** OPT-286's `apply-event.ts` reducer and `SandboxSessionProvider` consume `PartialGameState` and need to produce a value that satisfies `BoardLayout`'s `me`/`opp`/`turn`/`myIndex`/`cardDb`/`activePrompt` props. The provider is the field-drift surface — wire the smoke render test the scope doc calls for so this gets caught at PR time, not at runtime.

### OPT-286 → OPT-289
**From:** session on 2026-04-25 · **Commit:** `42a3fac` · **PR:** [#132](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/132)

- **Primer:** The fake `useGameSession` exists. `buildSandboxSession({ initialState, events, cardDb, activePrompt?, onAction?, onBackToLobbies? })` is the pure derivation; the runner can call it directly for replay-frame `i` without going through React. `useSandboxGameSession` is the hook that wraps it (adds router-based handleBackToLobbies + memoization). `applyEvent(state, event)` handles the eight visible-delta event types; everything else returns the state unchanged.
- **Read first:** `src/components/sandbox/sandbox-session-provider.tsx` (the public surface — start with `SandboxSessionInput` and `SandboxGameSession`), `src/lib/sandbox/apply-event.ts` (the reducer the runner folds), `src/components/sandbox/sandbox-session-provider.test.ts` (the field-drift contract — break it intentionally to see what fails).
- **Gotchas / do NOT touch:**
  - `eventLog` is exposed on **both** `session.game.eventLog` and `session.game.gameState.eventLog` and they share a reference. The runner should pass `events.slice(0, i)` for the current frame; do not mutate the array in place — `useMemo` deps rely on referential identity.
  - `applyEvent` is `(state, event) => state` for unhandled events. Returning the same reference is intentional — `mapPlayer` does the same when nothing changed. Keep this when adding cases; do not always allocate a new state.
  - Trashing / KO'ing / returning a field card with attached DON returns those DON to the cost area as **active and unattached**. If you add a new "leave the field" event in the future, mirror this — otherwise tokens disappear.
  - `applyEvent` does not search the leader slot for `locateAndRemove`. Leader card movements are not legal in current scenario scope; if a future case needs it, audit whether you actually want it.
- **Unresolved:**
  - No DOM-level smoke render test: vitest is configured for `environment: "node"` and the project doesn't ship JSDOM or `@testing-library/react`. The contract test in `sandbox-session-provider.test.ts` covers field drift via `BoardLayoutProps` assignment — sufficient for now, but if scenario authoring uncovers actual render-time issues, consider adding `@testing-library/react` + `happy-dom` and a real `<BoardLayout>` mount.
  - `applyEvent` only handles the eight scoped event types. The reducer-scope-creep risk remains live for OPT-289 — when authoring the runner, only add a new case if a scenario forces it.
- **Why this matters for OPT-289:** the runner owns the `(events, currentIndex)` state and calls `buildSandboxSession({ events: events.slice(0, currentIndex), ... })` per frame. Step-backward as a non-goal still applies — the docstring you'll write at the top of the runner file should say so. The reducer is "fold-friendly" by design; expect to call it repeatedly for play/stepForward and not at all for resolvePrompt.

### OPT-289 → OPT-290
**From:** session on 2026-04-25 · **Commit:** `701d047` · **PR:** [#133](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/133)

- **Primer:** The runner exists. `createScenarioRunner(scenario)` is the pure controller — owns the `setTimeout`, exposes `getState`/`subscribe`/`play`/`pause`/`reset`/`stepForward`/`resolvePrompt`/`dispose`. `useScenarioRunner` is the React hook over it via `useSyncExternalStore`. Derived state is recomputed (and cached per change) by folding `applyEvent` over `script[0..currentStepIndex]`'s events from `scenario.initialState`. `resumeTo` (`"playing" | "paused"`) records where to land after `resolvePrompt`.
- **Read first:** `src/components/sandbox/use-scenario-runner.ts` (controller + hook in one file), `src/components/sandbox/__tests__/use-scenario-runner.test.ts` (the playback contract — 14 tests covering all five acceptance scenarios plus pause-during-awaiting-response edges).
- **Gotchas / do NOT touch:**
  - `resolvePrompt(response)` accepts a `GameAction` for API symmetry but does not validate against `scenario.expectedResponse.predicate` — that's the gate's job (this is OPT-290's surface). The runner just advances. If you tighten this, do it in the gate, not the runner.
  - `useScenarioRunner` creates the controller exactly once via `useState(() => createScenarioRunner(scenario))`. Scenario reference changes after mount are silently ignored. Each scenario gets its own `[scenarioId]` page, so this is fine for now — file a follow-up if that assumption breaks.
  - The runner schedules timers with `setTimeout`, so vitest fake timers work transparently. Keep it that way; don't reach for `requestAnimationFrame` or `performance.now()` for delays — that breaks the test path.
  - Step-backward is a documented v1 non-goal — see top comment. Don't bolt it on without the Motion-timeline reset story; it'll desync `card-animation-layer`.
- **Unresolved:**
  - `pause()` while `playing` and `pause()` while `awaiting-response` both notify, but `pause()` from `idle`/`paused`/`ended` is a no-op without notify. If callers rely on `pause` to ping a listener, that's surprising; flag if OPT-290 hits it.
  - The runner exposes `dispose` but `useScenarioRunner` only calls it on unmount. If OPT-291 ever needs to swap scenarios in-place, add a scenario-change effect that disposes + creates fresh.
- **Why this matters for OPT-290:** OPT-290 wraps `session.sendAction` so interactive scenarios route the user's action through `expectedResponse.predicate` and, on match, call `runner.resolvePrompt(action)`. Spectator scenarios should disable input entirely (the ticket suggests trying `interactionMode` prop on `BoardLayout` first; pointer-events overlay is the fallback). The runner does not own input — only playback — so the gate is the single point that decides "did the user satisfy the prompt yet?"

### OPT-288 → OPT-291
**From:** session on 2026-04-25 · **Commit:** `fde8a3f` · **PR:** [#135](https://github.com/corycunanan/optcg-sim/pull/135)

- **Primer:** The `/sandbox` route surface is in place. Hub at `/sandbox` reads `scenarios` from the manifest and renders one section per `ScenarioCategory` (currently all "No scenarios yet"). `/sandbox/scaffold` is the migrated `BoardScaffold` host. `/sandbox/[scenarioId]/page.tsx` is the placeholder OPT-291 will replace — it already does the manifest lookup and `notFound()` for unknown ids. `/game/scaffold` is now a `permanentRedirect` (308). Navbar has a top-level "Sandbox" link.
- **Read first:** `src/app/sandbox/[scenarioId]/page.tsx` (the surface OPT-291 replaces — keep the param shape `Promise<{ scenarioId: string }>` and the `notFound()` branch), `src/app/sandbox/page.tsx` (hub — references `CATEGORY_ORDER`/`CATEGORY_LABELS` you may want to extract if scenario tiles need to share them), `src/components/nav/navbar.tsx` (Sandbox link + the `/game/` skip rule that intentionally does **not** apply to `/sandbox/*`).
- **Gotchas / do NOT touch:**
  - The navbar's `pathname.startsWith("/game/")` skip rule must stay for `/game/*` and must **not** be widened to `/sandbox/*` — the ticket explicitly calls this out as a default. If we later want to hide the nav during scenario playback, scope it to `inputMode === "interactive"` so spectator scenarios still show navigation.
  - `permanentRedirect` (308) was chosen over `redirect` (307) on `/game/scaffold` so search engines and bookmarks transfer cleanly. Don't downgrade.
  - Hub categories render even when empty by design — removing empty sections would hide which categories OPT-292+ scenarios should land in. Keep the `CATEGORY_ORDER` loop unconditional.
- **Unresolved:**
  - Found uncommitted OPT-290-flavored work in the tree (`src/components/game/board-layout/interaction-mode.ts` and a `board-layout.tsx` modification adding an `interactionMode` prop). Left it untouched on disk — it looks like an in-progress sketch from a prior session. OPT-290's owner should decide whether to adopt or discard before pushing.
  - `[scenarioId]` placeholder hard-codes the OPT-291 reference in copy. Update or remove that line as part of OPT-291.
- **Why this matters for OPT-291:** OPT-291 turns the placeholder into the real player. Reuse the existing `params: Promise<{ scenarioId: string }>` signature and the `notFound()` branch — only the JSX body changes. The hub's tile click already routes to `/sandbox/<id>`, so once a scenario is in the manifest the only friction is rendering the player. Pull provider (OPT-286), runner (OPT-289), and gate (OPT-290) into this page; nothing else in the route tree should need to move.
